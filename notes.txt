  - It shows sell button
- Click a tower in HUD to buy it, it becomes draggable, shows range
  - Tower turns red if you try to place it on top of an existing tower
  - Drop tower to place

- Baddies enter in waves, follow trench, try to reach base
- Baddies reaching base do 1 point of damage; game over when base HP exhausted
- Towers shoot at baddies when they're in range
